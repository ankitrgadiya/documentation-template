The footer of this template is very simple looking and consists of two lists,
one for left, and other for right.

The Copyright text is generated automatically using Global variables defined in
`_config.yml`.

To edit the lists:

* Open `./layouts/default.html`
* Go to line `119` for left list and `126` for the right list.
* To remove elements remove the full `<li>...</li>` tag.
* To remove the whole list, remove full `<ul>...</ul>` tag.
* To add elements add the following snippet inside `<ul>...</ul>` tag. (modify accordingly)

```
<li><a href="URL">NAME</a></li>
```
